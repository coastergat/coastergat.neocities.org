    <p>Hi! The name's Cooper but just call me Coop.</p>

    <p>I'm 16 and I've loved Pokemon ever since I was five, it's pretty much all I talk about lol. Currently, I'm a high school junior and I'm working towards getting into a good college so I can become an engineer.</p>

    <p>I spend most of my time on my laptop and 2DS, but I've also been wanting to get into sports. Other than that, I spend a ton of time with my best friend Wren. Currently, I'm working on ROM hacks for Red, Blue, and White (America?!)</p>

    <p>Funny fact: I originally had to beg my parents to get me my 2DS. Funniest thing was I didn't even know Pokemon video games were a thing until some kid brought one to school a year after I'd gotten my 2DS. Guess I can't fully blame myself, I didn't have internet access until I was 12. Oh, and I wanted the 2DS so I could play Mario Party... alone. Mario Party compilations on YouTube Kids are a captivating thing, what can I say?</p>
